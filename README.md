# Test Driven Development (TDD)

## Why us TDD?
- TDD makes you think of how to structure your code and application beforehand
- Lowers the probability of encountering a bug
- Having tests for all features makes adding new features easier

## TDD Steps:

- **Step 1** - Write a unit test that fails
- **Step 2** - Write production code that makes the test pass
- **Step 3** - Refactor and clean the code

### Testing with pytest and unittest
- Create a file called calc_test.py
- We will use `unittest` and `pytest`
- `pip install pytest`
- `python -m pytest` to run pytest
- `python -m unittest` to run unittest
- `python -m unittest discover -v` to run unittest with more information (verbose)
